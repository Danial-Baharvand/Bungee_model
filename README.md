As part of Brisbane's "New World City" transformation, the Brisbane City Council is investigating a proposal to allow bungee jumping off the Story Bridge. This model addresses several key questions about the proposal:

* Whether or not the jumper will bounce 10 times in approximately 60 seconds during the jump
* How much "thrill factor" the ride has; what is the fastest speed the jumper will experience and when
does the jumper experience it?

* How much "thrill factor" the ride has; is the bungee jump company's claim that the jumper will experience acceleration "up to 2g" accurate and what is the maximum acceleration the jumper will experience and when does the jumper experience it?

* How far does the jumper travel in the 60-second jump?
* At what time from the start of the jump does the jumper pass the deck?
* How can the rope be modified to incorporate a "water touch" option where the jumper just touches the
water at the first bounce without reaching acceleration greater than 2g while keeping as close as possible
to 10 bounces in 60 seconds?

The questions will be approached using the Modified Euler Method to model the jumper's distance, speed,
and acceleration against time. Separate functions will then be used to analyse and identify key values
relating to the questions. The Modified Euler Method attempts to model the motion of the bungee jump
as shown in the original model below.
